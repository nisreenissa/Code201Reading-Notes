There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition
<dl> definition list
<dt> definition term
<dd> definition
You can put a second list inside an <li> element to create a sublist or nested list.
<a> element you can use it with href attribute 
 Folders on a website are sometimes referred to as directories
You can use <a> with the attibute mailto:xxx@example.org this will dirrect you to the email 
If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening <a> tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.
The <div> element that contains this group of elements is then referred to as the containing element.
CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page
To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use
box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom
and left or right it should be placed.
Floating an element allows you to take that element out of normal flow and positionit to the far left or right of a containing box
positiong:static/absolute/relative /fixed
If you want to control which element sits on top, you can use the z-index property(when overlapping happens)

The clear property allows you to say that no element (within
the same containing element)should touch the left or righthand sides of a box. It can take the following values:
1- left:no elements on the left side 
2-right: no element on the right side
3-both:Neither the left nor right-hand sides of the box will touch elements appearing in the same containing element.
4- none:Elements can touch either side.

Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography)
is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are
organized on a page

Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
 CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
 You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
