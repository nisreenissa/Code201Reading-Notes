The html lanuage contains elemnts or in another word we will call it tag :
The opening <html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing </html> tag is HTML code.
The <body> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing
</body> tag should be shown inside the main browser window.
Words between <h1> and </h1> are a main heading which is the bigger header and the the smaller header is <h6>
<p> is the paragraph

Attributes : the attributes provide additional information about the content of an  elemnt , its made up of two parts : name and a value 

Example  :
<p lang="en-us">Paragraph in English</p>

The contents of the <title> element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page (if your browser uses tabs to allow you to view multiple pages at the same time).

there is  a text editor called notepad its a defult text editor made for windows you can use it to create HTML code by saving the file with html  extention.

if you will right click on any page on the browser and choose Source or View source you will see the whole code for this page .

DOCTYPE : decleration to tell a browser that this is a page  desgied by html code 
comments in html by using this code <!--  --> : we use it to remmber somthing or put a note , Comments can also be usedaround blocks of code to stop that code from being displayed in the browser

Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page, the value should start with uderscore or letter (not a number )
Class Attribute : several elements to be unique .
Block element will start a new line for example : <h1> <p> 
In line : will run in the same line for example : <a> <b>
The <div> element allows you to group a set of elements together.
Grouping Text & Elements Inline by using the tag <span>

<Iframes> its a page inside another page (lttle widow).
The <meta> element lives inside the <head> element and contains information about that web page.
Escape characters : there are some characters that are used in
and reserved by HTML code. (For example, the left and right angled brackets by &lt; ad &rt;)
______________________________________ 
we will talk now about one tag called <img> you can specify the dimension and  write your code with the source (path) for the image
like this <img src="you will put the source here" width="" height=""/>
what we did here is called CSS which mean styling your image and determine the width and the height is styling , the css will allow to style your page by using diffrent colors for your text or your background ,or you can change font and alot of stylings you will learn by practicing 

The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational 
blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

The <aside> element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an <article> element (cotain information on the overall meaning)or not.

The <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.
The <figure> element should
also contain a <figcaption> element which provides a text
decription for the content of the <figure> element. In this example, you can see a<figure> has been added inside the <article> element.

Good understanding of what your website should do and what it should look like gives lots of help for the building process, and here are some tips you can follow:

Who Is The Site For: it’s really important for you to really know the right audience that will view or use your website to determine how your website looks like and what the prober content to be viewed.
Hears Some Questions You Can Use To Decide That:

For the individual target audience:
What is the age range of your target audience?
Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?
Which country do your visitors live in?
Do they live in urban or rural areas?
What is the average income of visitors?
What level of education do they have?
What is their marital or family status?
What is their occupation?
How many hours do they work per week?
How often do they use the web?
What kind of device do they use to access the web?
For the companies target audience:
What is the size of the company or relevant department?
What is the position of people in the company who visit your site?
Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else?
How large is the budget they control?
Even you can invite some of your target audience for helping you get the right vision by asking them questions that can inflect you work.

Why People Visit Your Website: after you know your audience now you should think about why they are going to visit your website, you should figure out the underlying motivations for why visitors come to the site and the specific goals of the visitors.

What Your Visitors Are Trying To Achieve: it’s hard to list every reason why someone will visit your website but you can list the key motivations.

First, you want to create a list of reasons why people would be coming to your site, and then you can assign the list of tasks to the fictional visitors.

What Information Your Visitors Need: you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.

How Often People Will Visit Your Site: Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static.

Site Maps: You should start organizing the information into sections or pages in a diagram that will show you the structure for your website, and it’s always good to implement it in your website.


Wireframes: A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site, it shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

*Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.

Javascript :

Script
Script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a specific goal .

To write a script we need to state our goal first then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve them :
1. Define the goal
2. Design the script
3. Code each step

Your computer create models of world using the data stored in it , and those models will use objects, the objects will represent physical things ,the methods that perform tasks using the properties of that object , events which are triggered when a user interacts with the computer .
In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.
Programmers can write code to say when this event occurs , run that code .
 
The conclusion : HTML language will create the model as a structure and JavaScript will make your code interactive
