When the user interacts with the HTML on a web page, there are three
steps involved in getting it to trigger some JavaScript code.
Together these steps are known as event handling

in another words :HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.,which means when JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events

An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

Here are some examples of HTML events:

An HTML web page has finished loading
An HTML input field was changed
An HTML button was clicked
Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

Common HTML Events:
onchange	An HTML element has been changed
onclick	The user clicks an HTML element
onmouseover	The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
onmouseout	The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
onkeydown	The user pushes a keyboard key
onload	The browser has finished loading the page

Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen,, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon

HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.
