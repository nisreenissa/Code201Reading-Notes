Domain Modeling
Domain modeling is a way to write a code to solve your probelm ,it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.

Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.

The Math.floor() function returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.

The Math.random() function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range 0 to less than 1 (inclusive of 0, but not 1) with approximately uniform distribution over that range

New keyword in JavaScript is used to create an instance of an object that has a constructor function. On calling the constructor function with 'new' operator, the following actions are taken: A new empty object is created.

The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to.

------------------------
<figure> element to
contain images and their caption

The <figcaption> element has
been added to HTML5 in order
to allow web page authors to add
a caption to an image.
<table> create table 
<tr > table row 
<td > table data
<th> table heading

<thead>
The headings of the table should
sit inside the <thead> element

<tbody> the body sot nside <tbody>
<tfoot> The footer belongs inside the
<tfoot> element
The width attribute was used
on the opening <table> tag to
indicate how wide that table
should be and on some opening
<th> and <td> tags to specify
the width of individual cells.
The value of this attribute is
the width of the table or cell in
pixels.

You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
 ------------------
Local variable is declared inside a function whereas Global variable is declared outside the function. Local variables are created when the function has started execution and is lost when the function terminates, on the other hand, Global variable is created as execution starts and is lost when the program ends.

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a modelof a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,variables and functions take on new names. 
array are objects , they holds a related set of key/value pairs .but the key for each value is its index number 

Mathods:
document.write() :wirtes text to the document .
document . getElementByld() :Returns element, if there is an element with the value of the id attributethat matches
document. querySe 1ectorA11 () : Returns list of elements that match a CSS selector, which is specified as aparamete 
document.createElement() Creates new element
document.createTextNode() Creates new text node

Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into thebrowser window.

JavaScript also has several built-in objects such asString, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties andmethods offer functionality that help you write scripts.

Arrays and objects can be used to create complex datasets (and both can contain the other).
