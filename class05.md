---------------------------
CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may 
appear within an HTML page.
you can specify the color of the text by:
1- RGB (red /green /blue) 
2-Hex codes (#six digits)
3- the name of the  color itself 

background-color property sets the color of the background for that box.

Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color.

Brightness (or "value") refers to how much black is in a color. 

The CSS3 rgba property allows you to specify a color, just like
you would with an RGB value, but adds a fourth value to indicate opacity. This value is known as an alpha value and is a number between 0.0 and 1.0

it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
-------------------------
Serif fonts have extra details on the end of the main strokes of the letters.

Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters and therefore have a much cleaner design.

The font-family property allows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the element(s) to which a CSS rule applies.

You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.

 You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
