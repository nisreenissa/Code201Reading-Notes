CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to controlthe layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolutepositioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property 
1-formal flow 
2-relative positiong 
3-absolute positiong 

To use normal flow, you can set this property to position: static;
To use relative position, you can set this property to position: relative;
To use absolute position, you can set this property to position: absolute;
To use fixed position, you can set this property to position: fixed;
Using float property you can set where the index will appear.
width: This sets the width of the columns.
float:  moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts
margin: This creates a gap betweeen the columns.

There are some other factors that you have to consider when you are creating a web page such as:
Screen Sizes.
Screen Resolution.
Page Size

The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.
